    1. INT. BLACKOUT. CELLAR WITH A STAIRCASE IN THE BACKGROUND, 
            DOUGLAS IS BOUND TO A CHAIR BETWEEN THE STAIRCASE AND HARRY. 
            SUNLIGHT FROM BETWEEN TWO BARRED WINDOWS REFLECTS ON DUST 
            PARTICLES ON THE LEFT. IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE SHOT WE CAN 
            SEE TWO MEN (TED AND SETH) SITTING ON CRATES, WATCHING 
            DOUGLAS. ONLY THE AUDIO COMES THROUGH.

            As Harry speaks, we hear Douglas' labored breathing in the 
            background.

                            HARRY
                    Now, Doug, I'm going to count to 
                    three. Doug, look at me. Look. At. 
                    Me.  I'm going to count to three 
                    and when I do, you are going to 
                    tell me who paid you off, and when 
                    that happens, for the sake of 
                    everything that HAS happened, I am 
                    going to let you go.  If, by three, 
                    I don't hear your fucking mouth 
                    flapping out the words I need, then 
                    I am going to break your neck.  
                    What am I going to do Douglas?

            Pause, Breathing continues. We hear HARRY sigh and then a 
            surprised scream from DOUGLAS (unknown to the viewer there 
            is now a knife protruding from DOUGLAS' right leg.

                            HARRY
                    Stay sharp now Doug, I need your 
                    focus on me.  Tell me, what is 
                    about to happen, I want you to 
                    repeat for me the important points 
                    ... Doug?

                            DOUGLAS
                    (Gasping) You're. (A pause) You're 
                    going to count to three.

            We hear HARRY clap his hands once in approval.

                            HARRY
                    Good! Now, come on, what was the 
                    next part, what was your next line?

                            DOUGLAS
                    I'm... Please.

            We hear flesh sifting and DOUGLAS screams again.

                            DOUGLAS
                    (Shouting) I tell you! I tell you 
                    the names! That's! I tell you who, 
                    fu-please, stop!

                            HARRY
                    Right again.  See I knew you could 
                    do it.  Last question, if I reach 
                    three and I haven't heard what I 
                    needed to hear, what happens then?

                            DOUGLAS
                    (Another pause) You kill me.

                            HARRY
                    I what? Be specific, come on Doug 
                    where's that great brain.

                            DOUGLAS
                    (Swallows) You break my neck.

                            HARRY
                    Not so hard. Now that we're all on 
                    the same page.

    LIGHTS COME UP

                            HARRY
                    Let's get started.

                                                                  CUT TO:

    2. CLOSE SHOT - DOUGLAS, BLOODIED FACE AND HEAD BENT OVER, 
            ATTEMPTING TO CALM HIS BREATHING

                                                                  CUT TO:

    3. MOVING SHOT - FOLLOWING THE EDGE OF HARRY'S FACE DOWN TO 
            HIS MOUTH.

            Pause.

                            HARRY
                    One.

                                                                  CUT TO:

    4. BLACKOUT

    INT. OFFICE SETTING. 5 ROLLING CHAIRS ARE PULLED UP AROUND A 
            DESK IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM. SEATED ARE (IN CLOCKWISE 
            ORDER FROM TOP LEFT CORNER OF DESK) TED, HARRY, ABBY,

            5. Birds Eye Shot, rotating counterclockwise as the 
            conversation progresses below.

                            SETH
                    What I don't understand is, what's 
                    going to stop the feds from working 
                    through all the targets until they 
                    find the real heist.

                            ABBY
                    Well if you'd shut up and stop 
                    asking questions every three 
                    seconds then we could hear the rest 
                    of the plan.

                            TED
                    Look, there's-

                            HARRY
                    No, you two look.  The plan is 
                    going to work, now we only got 
                    through the first two steps.  
                    There's a lot more to go.
