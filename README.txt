Binghamton Film Initiative
==========================

The binghamton film initiative is a website for students that are interested in film and acting. It allows students with
possible ideas to post projects that they are trying to get done and then using a messaging system they can get whatever
positions they made need for the project.

How it was made
===============

This website is based off of joomla, communitty builder, kunena, and uddieim, however it required heavy customization
to reach the point that would be acceptable for the website to function as desired. You can find exact customizations in
the following folders:
modules/cblogin
components/com_profiler
components/com_kunena
components/com_uddieim
templates/meebo-white
